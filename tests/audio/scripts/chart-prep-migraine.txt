This is Sarah Chen, date of birth March 14th 1992, medical record number 12345. She's a 33 year old woman presenting for a new neurology consult for chronic migraines.

History is significant for episodic migraines starting at age 16. She's been on sumatriptan 100 milligrams as needed for the past several years. No prior preventive therapy has been tried. She also takes an oral contraceptive pill.

Family history is positive for migraines in her mother and maternal aunt.

Her migraines have been increasing in frequency. Chart review shows she was at about 4 to 5 headache days per month a year ago, but recent messages indicate she's now up to 12 to 15 headache days per month.

She's currently using sumatriptan about 10 to 12 times per month, which is above the medication overuse threshold of 10 days.

MRI brain without contrast from August 2024 was normal. No mass, no hemorrhage, no white matter lesions.

Allergies include penicillin, which causes a rash.

Key considerations for today's visit: high triptan use frequency suggests medication overuse headache component. She needs a preventive therapy discussion. MIDAS score from intake may help quantify disability. Consider whether the oral contraceptive is contributing.

I'd focus the HPI on the transformation from episodic to chronic pattern, the triptan overuse, and the impact on daily functioning.
