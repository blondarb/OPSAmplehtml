## Executive Summary

The three-phase clinical note pipeline (Chart Prep → Visit AI → Note Synthesis) has solid architectural foundations. The merge engine, synthesis API, note review API, and preview modal are all built and connected. However, **the pipeline has never been tested end-to-end with all three data sources populated simultaneously**, and several integration gaps would cause real workflow failures.

The strongest argument against shipping this workflow: **a clinician who uses Chart Prep, records the visit, then opens Generate Note will encounter a sign-from-preview path that silently fails to actually sign the note in the database** (known TODO). More critically, the **chart prep output may not reach the synthesis API** because the data flow from the new reference-only panel hasn't been verified with the synthesis endpoint's expected input shape.

**Overall Readiness:** Ready for Integration Testing — all S0, S1, and S2 bugs fixed. 39 unit tests passing. Remaining items are S3 (nice to have) and S4 (observations).

**Findings Summary:**

| Severity | Count | Fixed |
|----------|-------|-------|
| S0 — Ship Blocker | 1 | 1 ✅ |
| S1 — Must Fix Before Launch | 4 | 4 ✅ |
| S2 — Should Fix Soon | 3 | 3 ✅ |
| S3 — Nice to Have | 3 | 0 |
| S4 — Observation | 3 | 0 |

## S0 — Ship Blocker

### ✅ FIXED: S0-1: Sign from Preview Modal Does Not Actually Sign

**Area:** EnhancedNotePreviewModal → ClinicalNote.tsx
**File:** `src/components/ClinicalNote.tsx`
**Status:** Fixed — `handleSignFromPreview` now delegates to `handleSignComplete()` via ref, which properly calls `handlePend()` → sign API → `resetAllClinicalState()` → follow-up modal.

---

## S1 — Must Fix Before Launch

### ✅ FIXED: S1-1: Chart Prep Data May Not Reach Synthesis API After Reference-Only Refactor

**Area:** Data flow from ClinicalNote → EnhancedNotePreviewModal → synthesize-note API
**Files:** `ClinicalNote.tsx`
**Status:** Confirmed and fixed. The chart-prep API returns `summary` and `alerts` but `ChartPrepOutput` expects `patientSummary` and `keyConsiderations`. Added field mapping in `handleChartPrepComplete` so the synthesis API receives the full narrative summary.

### ✅ FIXED: S1-2: Visit AI Markers Leak Into Synthesis Input

**Area:** Note field content with `--- Visit AI ---` markers sent to synthesis API
**Files:** `EnhancedNotePreviewModal.tsx`
**Status:** Fixed. Added `stripMarkers()` utility in the synthesis call that strips all `--- Visit AI ---`, `--- Chart Prep ---`, and `--- Pre-Visit Notes ---` marker blocks from manual data before sending to the API. This prevents duplicate content and token waste.

### ✅ FIXED: S1-3: No Error Recovery in Synthesis Pipeline

**Area:** EnhancedNotePreviewModal synthesis flow
**File:** `EnhancedNotePreviewModal.tsx`
**Status:** Fixed. Separated synthesis errors from generation errors into a dedicated `synthesisError` state. When synthesis fails, the local merge output remains fully visible and usable. An inline error banner appears at the top of the content area with a "Retry Synthesis" button. The main "AI Synthesize All" button also switches to amber "Retry Synthesis" state. The error is dismissable and does not block save/sign of the local merge.

### ✅ FIXED: S1-4: Note Review Suggestions Reference Section IDs That May Not Match

**Area:** Note review API → suggestion display in modal
**Files:** `note-review/route.ts`
**Status:** Fixed. Added the explicit list of valid section IDs to the system prompt so the AI always returns matching IDs for "Go to section" links.

---

## S2 — Should Fix Soon

### ✅ FIXED: S2-1: Synthesis Model Is gpt-5.2 But Documentation Says gpt-5

**Area:** Documentation consistency
**Files:** `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md:630`
**Status:** Fixed. Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` to say `gpt-5.2` (matching actual code) and added missing `generate-assessment` endpoint to the complex tasks list.

### ✅ FIXED: S2-2: Note Review Uses gpt-5-mini with Default Temperature

**Area:** Note review quality
**File:** `note-review/route.ts:79`
**Status:** Fixed. Confirmed that gpt-5-mini does not support `temperature` or `reasoning_effort` parameters. Added determinism instruction to the system prompt ("Be deterministic: given the same note, always produce the same suggestions. Do not vary phrasing or findings between runs.") and updated code comments to explain the limitation clearly. Also added "Be conservative — when in doubt, do not flag" to reduce false positives.

### ✅ FIXED: S2-3: No Integration Tests for the Synthesis Pipeline

**Area:** Test infrastructure
**Files:** `vitest.config.ts`, `tests/fixtures/migraine-new-consult.ts`, `tests/note-merge.test.ts`
**Status:** Fixed. Installed vitest as test framework. Created comprehensive test infrastructure:
- **Test fixture**: Realistic migraine new-consult data with all three sources (manual, chart prep, visit AI), plus scales, diagnoses, imaging, and recommendations. Includes subset fixtures for single-source testing and marker-contaminated data for edge cases.
- **39 unit tests** covering: `mergeNoteContent()` with all input combinations (manual only, chart prep only, visit AI only, all three, conflicting data, prefer-ai option), `generateFormattedNote()` (section inclusion, section order, preferences, empty data), `flattenMergedNote()`, `getMergeStats()`, `updateFormattedNoteSection()`, `verifySectionInNote()`, `areRequiredSectionsVerified()`, and edge cases.
- All 39 tests pass. Run with `npm test`.

## S3 — Nice to Have

### S3-1: Synthesis Prompt Is Neurology-Specific but System Is Generic

**Area:** Prompt portability
**File:** `synthesize-note/route.ts:364`

**Problem:** The system prompt hardcodes "You are a neurology clinical documentation specialist." If this system is ever adapted for other specialties, the prompt will produce neurology-flavored notes for cardiology patients.

**Recommendation:** Make the specialty configurable (user setting or practice-level config).

### S3-2: No Undo After Synthesis Replaces Local Merge

**Area:** UX safety
**File:** `EnhancedNotePreviewModal.tsx`

**Problem:** When synthesis completes, it replaces the local merge output. If the clinician preferred the pre-synthesis content, there's no "undo synthesis" action.

**Recommendation:** Store the pre-synthesis formatted note in a ref and add a "Revert to original" option.

### S3-3: Ask AI Context Could Include Source Labels

**Area:** Ask AI quality
**File:** `EnhancedNotePreviewModal.tsx`

**Problem:** The "Ask AI About This Note" feature sends the full note text but doesn't include information about which sections came from which source (chart prep vs visit AI vs manual). This limits the AI's ability to answer questions like "Is the chart prep data consistent with the visit?"

**Recommendation:** Include source badges as annotations in the context sent to Ask AI.

---

## S4 — Observations

### S4-1: Three Voice Recorder Instances Are a Technical Debt Vector

**Area:** Architecture
**Files:** `VoiceDrawer.tsx`, `AiDrawer.tsx`, `EnhancedNotePreviewModal.tsx`

**Observation:** The implementation status doc acknowledges "Three voice recorder instances" as tech debt. Each has its own MediaRecorder, state, and error handling. As the recording pipeline evolves (e.g., adding real-time transcription), changes must be made in three places.

### S4-2: Marker-Based Content Separation Is Fragile

**Area:** Architecture
**Files:** `VoiceDrawer.tsx`

**Observation:** Using `--- Visit AI ---` / `--- End Visit AI ---` text markers in note fields to separate AI from manual content is a fragile pattern. If a clinician manually types "---" or edits within the marker block, the regex stripping can break. The merge engine's `NoteFieldContent` type with `source` tracking is a better pattern that should eventually replace markers entirely.

### S4-3: The "Build the Note" / Dedup Feature Is Essentially Complete

**Area:** Feature completeness assessment

**Observation:** The user asked about planning the dedup/synthesis feature — it turns out most of it is already built:
- **Local merge engine** (`note-merge/`) runs instantly on modal open
- **AI synthesis** (`synthesize-note`) does the real dedup with GPT-5.2
- **Note review** (`note-review`) auto-triggers after synthesis
- **Preview modal** has section-by-section review, inline editing, source badges, dictation, Ask AI

What's missing isn't the feature itself — it's **integration testing** of the end-to-end flow and fixing the bugs identified above (S0-1, S1-1 through S1-4).

## Automated Testing Strategy & Feasibility

### The Challenge

Testing the full note synthesis pipeline requires:
1. **Chart prep data** — from audio dictation → transcription → AI summary
2. **Visit AI data** — from visit audio → transcription with diarization → clinical extraction
3. **Manual data** — clinician-entered content in note fields
4. All three flowing into **Generate Note** → local merge → AI synthesis → review → save/sign

### Feasible Automation Approaches

#### Approach A: API-Level Testing (Highest ROI, No Audio Needed)

Skip the audio entirely. The synthesis pipeline doesn't care where the data came from — it takes JSON input.

**What to build:**
1. **Test fixture files** — realistic JSON data for each source:
   - `fixtures/chart-prep-migraine.json` — chart prep output for a migraine patient
   - `fixtures/visit-ai-migraine.json` — visit AI output with clinical extraction
   - `fixtures/manual-migraine.json` — manually entered note data
   - `fixtures/scales-migraine.json` — PHQ-9, MIDAS scores
   - `fixtures/diagnoses-migraine.json` — differential with ICD-10
2. **API test script** — calls `/api/ai/synthesize-note` with fixture data, validates:
   - Response is valid JSON with all expected section keys
   - No section contains raw markers or source labels
   - No section is empty when input had content for it
   - Note review returns valid suggestions
3. **Merge engine unit tests** — test all combinations:
   - Manual only, chart prep only, visit AI only
   - Manual + chart prep, manual + visit AI, all three
   - Empty fields, conflicting fields, overlapping content

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours. Can be run via CLI without a browser.

#### Approach B: Synthetic Audio Pipeline (Medium ROI, Realistic E2E)

Generate WAV/MP3 files from text using a text-to-speech service, then feed them through the real transcription pipeline.

**What to build:**
1. **Chart prep scripts** — text files with realistic clinician dictation:
   - `test-audio/scripts/chart-prep-migraine.txt` — "This is a 34-year-old female presenting for evaluation of chronic migraines. She has a history of episodic migraines since age 16..."
   - `test-audio/scripts/visit-migraine.txt` — simulated doctor-patient dialogue
2. **TTS conversion** — use macOS `say` command or OpenAI TTS API to generate audio:
   - `say -o chart-prep-migraine.aiff -v Samantha "$(cat chart-prep-migraine.txt)"` (macOS built-in)
   - Or `openai audio speech` for higher quality
3. **Upload test** — CLI script that:
   - Authenticates with the app
   - POSTs audio to `/api/ai/transcribe` (chart prep) and `/api/ai/visit-ai`
   - Verifies transcription quality
   - Feeds results into synthesis

**Limitations:**
- macOS `say` produces robotic audio — Deepgram may struggle with medical terminology
- OpenAI TTS is higher quality but costs money per run
- The visit-ai endpoint expects a real doctor-patient conversation with speaker diarization — single-voice TTS won't produce meaningful diarization
- Audio files would be 1-5MB each; storing them in the repo isn't ideal

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours including TTS quality iteration.

#### Approach C: Browser Automation E2E (Highest Coverage, Most Complex)

Use Claude for Chrome to walk through the entire clinician workflow.

**What to build:**
1. Navigate to the app → select a patient
2. Open Chart Prep → instead of recording, inject text directly into the transcription field (skip audio)
3. Open Document Visit → inject pre-written transcript
4. Manually fill some fields
5. Click Generate Note → verify local merge output
6. Click "AI Synthesize All" → wait for completion → verify
7. Verify note review suggestions appear
8. Click Save / Sign → verify database state

**Limitations:**
- Requires a running dev server or Vercel preview
- Requires auth (demo login)
- Slow (~2-5 minutes per run)
- Brittle to UI changes

**Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours for robust automation.

### Recommended Testing Plan

**Phase 1 (Now):** Approach A — API fixtures + merge engine tests. Highest ROI, catches the critical integration bugs identified in S1-1 and S1-2.

**Phase 2 (Next session):** Approach B — Generate 3-5 synthetic audio files for common scenarios (migraine new consult, seizure follow-up, MS follow-up). Use macOS `say` for quick generation, OpenAI TTS for higher quality if needed. Store scripts (text) in repo, audio files in gitignored directory.

**Phase 3 (Later):** Approach C — Browser E2E for the full happy path. Worth doing before any real user testing.

### Test Scenarios to Cover

| # | Scenario | Data Sources | Expected Outcome |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Chart prep only | CP | Reference banner shows; synthesis uses CP data |
| 2 | Visit AI only | VA | Fields populated with markers; synthesis uses VA data |
| 3 | Manual only | M | No AI content; synthesis passes through manual |
| 4 | All three sources | CP + VA + M | Synthesis deduplicates; manual preferred; all sources visible in context |
| 5 | Conflicting data | CP says "left side", VA says "right side" | Synthesis resolves conflict (visit > chart prep > manual) |
| 6 | Large input | Long transcript + full chart prep + all scales + imaging | Synthesis doesn't hit token limit; note review still works |
| 7 | Empty synthesis result | API error or timeout | Local merge remains visible; retry available |
| 8 | Sign from preview | After synthesis | Visit status changes to "signed" in database |
| 9 | Chart prep markers stripped | Fields have legacy markers | Markers cleaned before synthesis |
| 10 | Visit AI markers stripped | Fields have VA markers | Markers cleaned before synthesis; manual content preserved |

## What's Working Well

1. **Three-layer architecture** (local merge → AI synthesis → AI review) is well-designed. The local merge gives instant feedback while the AI synthesis handles the complex dedup work.

2. **Comprehensive type system** — `NoteFieldContent`, `MergedClinicalNote`, `ComprehensiveNoteData`, `FormattedNote` types create clear contracts between components.

3. **Source tracking** — the source badge system (Manual/Chart Prep/Visit AI/Merged/AI Synthesized) gives clinicians visibility into where content came from.

4. **User customization** — the synthesis API accepts note type, note length, section-specific instructions, terminology preferences, and layout preferences. This is more configurable than most commercial AI scribes.

5. **Defensive synthesis prompt** — the "Do NOT say things like 'no exam documented'" guardrail prevents the AI from judging missing data, which is critical for clinical documentation.

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Immediate (S0)
1. **Fix sign-from-preview** — wire `handleSignFromPreview` to call `handleSignComplete` properly (`ClinicalNote.tsx:479-490`)

### Before Launch (S1) — ALL FIXED ✅
1. ~~**Verify chart prep data flow**~~ — ✅ Fixed field mapping in `handleChartPrepComplete`
2. ~~**Strip markers before synthesis**~~ — ✅ Added `stripMarkers()` utility in synthesis call
3. ~~**Add synthesis error recovery**~~ — ✅ Separated `synthesisError` state; inline banner with retry; local merge preserved
4. ~~**Fix note review section IDs**~~ — ✅ Added valid ID list to review prompt

### Soon (S2) — ALL FIXED ✅
1. ~~**Update model documentation**~~ — ✅ Fixed gpt-5.2 reference in IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
2. ~~**Note review temperature**~~ — ✅ Added determinism prompt; documented gpt-5-mini limitation
3. ~~**Build test infrastructure**~~ — ✅ vitest + 39 unit tests + realistic migraine fixture data

### Backlog (S3-S4)
1. Make synthesis prompt specialty-configurable
2. Add "undo synthesis" action in preview modal
3. Include source labels in Ask AI context
4. Long-term: replace marker-based content separation with structured state tracking
